# CV Application Creator

This app lets you enter information into a form which autopopulates onto a CV Application ready for print and download. 

## Created while completing The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript.

Creating this app allows me to practice and learn using React with class components, using forms in react, and passing props and updating state in React.
